# HDMClouds 
A Hierarchical Decomposition of Molecular Clouds Based on Gaussian Mixtures

The code in this repository implements the algorithm presented in _HDMClouds: a hierarchical decomposition of molecular clouds based on Gaussian mixtures_ (__DOI:__ [10.1093/mnras/sty2788](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty2788)) published in MNRAS, as part of the work for my master thesis degree.
